# AWT-LSTM-ARIMAX-FIEGARCH Hybrid Model

This repository contains the research and codebase for my **Investment Analysis MSc Research Project**. The project develops a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates econometric models, wavelet-based signal processing, and deep learning to improve stock market prediction accuracy.

## üìñ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to forecast the **S&P 500 index** by combining:
- **Adaptive Wavelet Transform (AWT):** For multi-frequency decomposition and denoising of financial time series.
- **ARIMAX-FIEGARCH Models:** To capture linear dependencies, long memory, and volatility dynamics.
- **LSTM Networks:** To learn nonlinear temporal patterns in returns and exogenous variables.

This hybrid model aims to outperform standalone econometric and deep learning models by leveraging both statistical rigor and machine learning flexibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - S&P 500 OHLCV data  
   - Exogenous variables: Dollar Index, WTI Oil prices  
   - Technical indicators derived from trading data  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Compute log returns  
   - Apply Adaptive Wavelet Transform for noise reduction  
   - Conduct stationarity & long memory tests  
   - Fit ARIMAX-FIEGARCH for conditional mean & volatility  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Select important trading indicators with XGBoost  
   - Add lagged returns and exogenous variables  
   - Normalize and scale inputs  

4. **LSTM Modeling**  
   - Multi-layer LSTM with adaptive weighting for wavelet components  
   - Hyperparameter tuning (layers, neurons, dropout, etc.)  
   - Rolling window evaluation for multiple forecast horizons  

5. **Ensemble Forecasting & Evaluation**  
   - Nonlinear integration of wavelet components using Random Forest  
   - Evaluate forecasts using RMSE, MAE, R¬≤, SMAPE  
   - Benchmark against traditional models
